    "&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**This project involves the implementation and employment of a recurrent neural network with embedding and advanced attentional mechanisms for sentiment analysis, particularly training on and analyzing tweets. Sentiment analysis, as implied by the term, involves analyzing the content of a given text to determine the emotional undertone or sentiment most appropriate to it. This practice is particularly helpful for a variety of purposes, chief among them is understanding and learning from public perception and public opinion, whether to understand the public stance towards a particular topic, company, or service; for research and development; to better manage and monitor social spaces (for instance by uprooting hateful, inciting or inflammatory content); or even to better understand the general social and political climate, which has a direct bearing on the stocks and forex markets and can thus inform decisions related thereto. Indeed, with the unrelenting increased digitization of the public sphere, sentiment analysis, especially as applied to large-scale social media platforms like X/twitter, has become pivotal for companies everywhere to better manage the public reception of their products and services and to ensure their betterment and meet customers' expectations aptly, thus greatly aiding companies' pursuit of growth and quality. To that end, I endeavoured to develop a recurrent neural network with various attentional and optimization mechanisms and train it on a large dataset of tweets to learn to distinguish between different sentiment and identify the correct sentiment for each individual tweet.**\n",

    "&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**The dataset presented here was taken from Kaggle, which you can quickly access from the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/twitter-tweets-sentiment-dataset/). This dataset is comprised of approximately 27,500 tweets, each tweet labelled in advance with the sentiment appropriate to it. Sentiment labels present are simply \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\". Each row in the data includes the tweet's text content and a corresponding sentiment label. The goal here, as mentioned, is to develop a neural network that learns from this dataset to correctly identify the sentiment or emotion that perfectly fits a given post.**<br> \n",

    "&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Prior to model development, the dataset was quickly inspected and cleaned before being thoroughly preprocessed and prepared for training. Preparatory steps included removing hyperlinks, hashtags, stop words, emojis and emoticons, and lemmatization. The tweets were then tokenized and padded to be fed appropriately to the model. A recurrent neural network was then developed and trained for sentiment analysis. It was also endowed with several attentional capabilities to facilitate sentiment analysis. As such, this network roughly consisted of the following: an embedding layer for word embedding; a mask layer, which specialized in masking sentiment or emotional words, adding more emphasis to them during training; a bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer to learn context and semantic dependencies in the data; a self-attention for added importance on the most relevant parts of the text; and finally a dense layer with 3 units for classification. Each layer fedforward to the next one before terminating at the classification layer to identify the sentiment appropriate to a given tweet. Finally, the network was then tested on a separate testing set for a final evaluation. The network yielded considerably favorable results.** <br>\n",

First, I will start with the target variable, sentiment, performing label encoding to give numeric labels to the sentiment classes and make them viable for analysis. Then, I will turn to the text data (tweets), performing text preprocessing to cut through the clutter and filter the text to its most informative elements. This process will consist of the following:\n",

    "Now I will proceed to deal with the text data in particular. To facilitate the process, I will create a custom function that handles most of the text processing steps in one go and apply it on the dataset. This function, `preprocess_text`, should normalize the text, remove hyperlinks, mentions, hashtags, punctuations, and stopwords, and lastly lemmatize the text. I will also create a second function, `remove_emojis`, that will identify and remove all emojis, emoticons and symbols from the data. This should output a completely clean version of the text. Finally, I will perform text tokenization and padding."

Well, first I will attempt to establish a baseline for performance by training a simple classification model, particularly a logistic regression model. Then, I will proceed to building the network to compare the results. This network should roughly consist of embedding layer, a sentiment mask layer for attention to sentimental or sentiment-adjascent terms, a bidirectional LSTM layer, a trainable self-attention layer, and finally a classification layer, as well as optimization and dropout layers in between (*see full architecture below*). What makes this network particularly special is the attentional capabilities built into it, making it particularly specialized for the task of sentiment analysis.  With that being said, I shall proceed with establishing a performance baseline for the network to come. \n",

Well, this should be expected for, indeed, these simple machine learning models are not particularly made for dealing with text data or natural language processing (NLP), unlike neural networks with specialized layers. Nonetheless, I will use this as a starting point, a baseline, against which I will compare the performance of the neural network to be built after training, which will give us a rough idea about how it fares relative to traditional machine learning models like this one.

    "### Model Design and Architecture <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we turn to model development. In this part, I will elaborate on the design of the network and the preparatory steps required for building it. The chief purpose of this network is to learn the appropriate embeddings by modeling a large collection of tweets and their corresponding sentiment labels so that it's able to perform sentiment analysis and thus become capable of identifying the sentiments most appropriate to any given tweet, especially in the case of positive and negative sentiments. As such, overall it will perform word embeddings, focusing more heavily on sentiment embeddings; attend to local patterns and word combinations most predictive; learn context and semantic dependencies between words in a sentence; learn to attend to the most relevant/predictive details; and finally classify tweets based on what have been learned, labeling each tweet as either positive, negative, or neutral. To that end, this network will primarily cosist of the following layers:<br>\n",
    "<div style=\"padding-left: 1em; max-width: 1350px;\">\n",
    "<p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) Embedding layer:** a word embedding layer for transforming word tokens into (300-dimensional) dense vectors that represent semantic relationships in the input word sequences fed to it. This layer will utilize GloVe's pre-trained embedding weights for a start, but will remain trainable. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) Gaussian Noise layer:** this noise layer, enabled only during training, will introduce slight purtubations or noise into the learned word representations to help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting on the training data, forcing the network to rely on more stable and robust patterns. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Sentiment Mask layer:** this masking layer will take in the embeddings from the earlier layer and the input word tokens and apply additional emphasis on sentiment terms, increasing their respective weights by a certain factor. To perform masking appropriately, I used a dictionary of sentimental or sentiment-laden terms (collected from EmoLex), and tokenized it using the same tokenizer for current text corpus to allow direct comparisons based on this particular dataset. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**(4) Self-Attention layer:** a scaled dot-product attention layer with trainable weights to help selectively focus on the most relevant words relative to their sequences overall, even if far apart in time, assigning added weight to these terms deemed relevant or important for predicting sentiment. Such self-attention layers are particularly good for short and noisy data like tweets with a lot of slang and abrupt transitions. Further, placed after the sentiment mask layer, and before the convolutional layers, this layer would, on the one hand, quickly spot crucial sentiment-laden tokens emphasized by the earlier before it and add further emphasis on them before structural modeling dilutes them later on, while, on the other hand, feeding a cleaner, better curated inputs to the later convolutional layers for improved feature extraction. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**(5) Convolutional 1D and Max Pooling layers:** two parallel convolutional 1D layers with kernel sizes of 3 and 4 followed by max pooling layers for n-grams processing to detect and extract local n-gram patterns from the sequences (similar to how 2D convolutions in convolutional neural networks scan for local spatial features in images), which would help capture word combinations most predictive or important in a given sequence (instead of relying on singular terms). The first convolutional layer will use a kernel size of 3 for extracting 3-gram features (e.g., \"very good movie\"), while the second will use a kernel size of 4 for extracting 4-gram features (e.g., \"not my best day\"), which should accordingly help the network better perform sentiment analysis using the local patterns detected. The output from these layers will then be combined using a Concatenate layer and reshaped for subsequent processing the LSTM layer.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**(6) Bidirectional Long-Short Term (LSTM) layer:** a specialized variant of a recurrent layer designed to capture temporal or semantic dependencies within the text sequences (sentences) and establishing long-term context. This layer will also be bidirectional, meaning that it will encode past and future contexts, scanning the sequences forwards and backwards, which should yield a richer context for understanding the text before producing sentiment classifications. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**(7) Global Average Pooling 1D layer:** this layer compresses the variable-length sequence output from the self-attention layer into a fixed-size vector by averaging across all time steps. This vector would serve as a distilled summary of the most relevant features across the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**(8) Dense layer for classification:** a final dense layer with 3 units and softmax activation for multi-class classification, producing probability scores for each sentiment category (neutral, positive, negative).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> \n",
    "<i>In addition to these layers, the network will be peppered with dropout layers and regularization techniques throughout to further prevent overfitting and promote generalizability.</i>\n",

    "\n",
    "Now before training, a few preparations are imparative. As briefly mentioned, in order to give the embedding layer a head start and promote better learning, I will use Stanford's [GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)]((https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/))'s pretrained embeddings instead of learning word semantic representations from scratch GloVe's embeddings have been trained on a very large text corpus with approximately 840 billion tokens which thus already capture a lot of general language understanding and semantic relationships between words. This will take off a lot of the heavy lifting of learning word meanings from scratch. Nonetheless, given that with tweets we are not dealing with straightforward traditional English but a lot of slang, I will make this layer trainable all the same. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Another prerequisite for training, particularly by the sentiment mask layer, is to prepare a lexicon of emotional and sentiment-bearing words that the layer can use for sentiment masking. For this task, I will utilize the National Research Council Canada (NRC)'s [Word-Emotion Association Lexicon](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm) (or EmoLex). The NRC's Emotion Lexicon consists of a list of English words and their association with the 8 basic emotion categories and two overarching sentiment categories (positive and negative). I will extract out all the terms from the lexicon, cross-check them against the current text corpus, and tokenize the terms found in that corpus with the same tokenizer used for it, thus ensuring consistency between the emotional lexicon and the dataset's lexicon. I will now begin with building and tokenizeing the sentiment lexicon to be used by the sentiment mask layer, and then proceed to prepare the weights matrix for the embedding layer.\n"

    "As illustrated, the model training and performance on testing were satisfactory. Indeed, accuracy improved significantly from the baseline, increasing by 75%, with overall accuracy score of 0.72 (compared to 0.40 at baseline). Further, more importantly, the model successfully learned to differentiate positive and negative sentiments from each other and from neutral ones. We can see this more strikingly with the recall and F1 scores. Whereas the recall and F1 scores hardly went above 0.1 at baseline for positive and negative sentiments, with the current network they shot up to ~0.7-0.75. This indeed shows that the network learned appropriate embeddings, carving up a satisfactory representations space for the words and their semantic relationships and dependencies. This makes perfect sense of course as these types of networks are specialized for such a type of task, using a specialized embedding layer for word representation, sentiment emphasis and self-attention layers for identifying emotional terms and relevant terms overall, as well as convolutional layers for local pattern and feature extraction and a LSTM layer for context awareness and learning temporal/semantic dependencies. None of these capabilities are available for the simple logistic regression model, hence the stark difference in performance. Now we can use the model to generate sentiment predictions on a random sample of data from the testing set."

    "In summary, this project set out to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using deep learning and NLP techniques. An advanced recurrent neural network was developed for the task, incorporating sophisticated sentiment detection and attentional capabilities, and used to classify tweets into positive, neutral, or negative. As demonstrated by the training history and evaluation metrics, the model achieved a relatively strong performance, with good accuracy and generalization to the test set. The network was also tested on individual tweets, providing real-time sentiment classification capability, and was able to make generally reasonable and consistent sentiment predictions across a variety of tweets, indicating that it effectively learned from the training data. Thus, the project successfully leveraged deep learning to develop a functional sentiment analysis model capable of classifying tweet sentiments with considerable accuracy."
